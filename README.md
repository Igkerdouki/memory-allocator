# Memory Allocator (C)

This project implements a custom dynamic memory allocator
similar to malloc and free.

It manages a virtual heap using metadata, free lists,
and page-based allocation.

Features:
- Custom malloc / free
- Block splitting and coalescing
- Heap initialization
- Memory bookkeeping

Built in C as part of a systems programming course.
All core allocation logic was written by me.

What I learned:
- Heap layout
- Pointer arithmetic
- Memory fragmentation
- Low-level debugging
